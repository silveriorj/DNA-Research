# DNA-Research
A simple program that search for DNA combinations of three diferent kinds of spiders in three text files with randon characters.

The system was developed in C language, using the basics libraries, <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h> and <string.h>.
It consists in a algorithm that research for simple combinations of 6 characters for each family or genre, for each specimen of spiders in that three files.

Each file consists in 20K lines and 50 columns with random characters.
For the research, I don't consider the end of the line, represented by the special character '\n', so if the combination continues in the next line, it will be counts normally.
